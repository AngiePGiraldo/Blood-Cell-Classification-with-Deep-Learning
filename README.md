# Blood-Cell-Classification-with-Deep-Learning
This project analyzes and trains neural networks for blood cell image classification using the Breast Histopathology Images dataset from Kaggle. Four models were implemented: three CNN architectures and one VGG-based model. Performance was evaluated based on accuracy and loss, optimizing image size, batch size, and epochs for better convergence.
